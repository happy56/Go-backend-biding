# Project Description: Golang Backend with MongoDB, Bidding, Reviews, File Upload, and JSON API
This project implements a robust Golang backend server that caters to a marketplace or auction-style application. It utilizes MongoDB for flexible data storage and retrieval, empowers users with a bidding system, facilitates review creation for enhanced trust, and integrates file uploading for richer data representation. Communication with the frontend is facilitated through a well-structured JSON API.

### Key Features:
#### MongoDB Integration: 
Leverages MongoDB's scalability and document-oriented nature to efficiently store and manage diverse data models related to products, bids, reviews, uploaded files, and user accounts (if applicable).



### Generic Table/Model Driver for MongoDB in Golang

Generic: Designed to work with different data models without requiring code modification for each table. This promotes code reusability and reduces boilerplate code.
Type Safety: Leverages Golang's type system for strong typing and improved code maintainability and error handling.
CRUD Operations: Provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in MongoDB collections.
Query Builder (Optional): Consider including a flexible query builder to construct complex queries using chaining and filtering mechanisms.
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to gracefully handle database connection errors, invalid operations, and other potential issues.


#### Bidding System: 
Provides a mechanism for users to submit bids on listed items, potentially driving auctions or fostering a competitive marketplace environment. Bid management logic ensures fairness and handles scenarios like outbidding, closing bids, and winner notification.

#### Review System: 
Enables users to leave reviews and ratings on products or services, fostering trust and transparent interactions. The review system can be designed to include features like moderation, filtering by rating, and displaying average ratings.

#### File Uploader: 
Supports uploading various file types (images, documents, etc.) to enrich product listings, user profiles, or other relevant entities. Robust error handling and security measures are essential for file uploads.

#### JSON API: 
Exposes a well-defined JSON API for seamless communication with the frontend. This API should provide endpoints for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on resources, user authentication (if applicable), and actions related to bidding, reviews, and file uploads. Consider using a popular framework like Gin or Gorilla Mux for efficient API development.
